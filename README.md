# dotfiles

This is a collection of my system configuration files I use on several Linux machines and my personal computer, shared here for your and my convenience.
These files are strongly opinionated. 
While being a *nix user I currently use a Windows 11 machine with [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/archive/blogs/wsl/windows-subsystem-for-linux-overview). 
This allows me to use things like Windows Hello or the Windows Precision Drivers that are both supported from my machine while still enjoying Linux.

## Usage

```bash
$ ./script/bootstrap
```
